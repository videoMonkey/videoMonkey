Things I don’t like about Youtube Music:
- It’s slow to start up
- I can’t add a whole album to a playlist
- I can’t make collaborative playlists in the app

Things I like: 
- Good music selection
- The app has been improved over time
- I like how cheap the premium upgrade is to get ad-free YouTube
