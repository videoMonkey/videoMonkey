# Journalling & Emotion Words

As a believer in Christ, I know that my physical body is the result of more than just chemistry and physics: There are deep connections between my spirit and my body. Journalling may be my pharoh, but I also have experienced the tremendous healing and strength through regularly journalling my emotions. What follows is cue card to help me put words to what I feel inside.
