title: My Daily Prayer

> Soveregin Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your power and outstretched arm, NOTHING is too hard for you. <cite style='white-space:nowrap'>&mdash Jeremaiah:32:17</cite>

I confess and repent: my obedience doesn’t reflect your greatness, my trust doesn’t reflect your provision, my attitude doesn’t reflect your promise. 

I want to follow you God! Grant me the wisdom to know your way and the courage to follow wherever it might lead.

I thank you: For good rest. For good health. For your provision. For my beautiful wife and daughter. For our home. For our daily bread. 

I petition you: For wisdom & contentment. For complete recovery of health. For the health and well-being of my wife and daughter. For our daily bread. FOR ONE MILLION CHRISTIANS IN MOROCCO. 

_Now I bring in other prayer requests._
