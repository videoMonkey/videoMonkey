**Go slow to go fast**. I struggle to want to, when I start my day, before ingesting any information from a screen, stop for 10 minutes in The Word, spend 30 minutes on a walk reflecting on the things on my mind, then spend another 30 minutes writing them down and praying about it, and then spending another 10 minutes looking through my notes and obligations and deciding what I can get done today.

But I never regret doing it.

and when I do that, I can work productively consecutive days, sun-up to sun-down and not grow weary. Without that time, I struggle to get a meaningful hour of work into a day.
